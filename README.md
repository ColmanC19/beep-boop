Beep-Boop


Week 3 project for Epicodus working on Arrays and Looping. 11.1.2019
By Colman Currie
Third independent project I completed for Epicodus.
Simple form that will ask a user to input their name and any number they wish. The program will retun a string of numbers back to the user while replacing certain numbers. I used html, css, javascript, bootstrap and jquery to make it. 

Setup/Installation Requirements
Using your terminal you can git clone this project to your desktop.

Then you will call the directory using your terminal, make sure you're in the desktop and cd "project name here"

If you don't wish to make any changes you can simply double click the index.html inside that cloned directory and it will open an html page in your internet browser.

_Or visit the page here: https://colmanc19.github.io/beep-boop

Specs:
1)The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number
  User input 4, expected outcome would be "0,1,2,3,4"
2) Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
  User input 3, expected outcome "0,1,2,"I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.""
3) Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
  User input 3, expected outcome "0,1,Boop,I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
4) Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
  User input 1, expected outcome "0,Beep.
These specs are written in order of importance. See below for examples on what to expect for an outcome
The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
The number 32 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
I believe you can run this on any system. I did download the most recent version of bootstrap and jquery

No known bugs at this point

If you run into any issues, or want any additional information please contact me at curriecolman@gmail.com.

I used html, css, javascript, bootstrap (* Bootstrap v3.3.7 (http://getbootstrap.com)) and jquery (jQuery JavaScript Library v3.4.1 https://jquery.com/).
